# Education Kernel Development in Rust

This is written for a RaspberryPI 4 Board, inted for ARM64 architecture and targets M-Cortex Raspberry PI 4 Boards. A docker container is used which automates the build and emulation of the kernel. Clone the official [RaspberryPi Firmware Repository](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware) to get access to the firmware needed to boot the kernel image.
